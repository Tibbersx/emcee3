Seriously Kick-Ass MCMC
-----------------------

**emcee3** is an MIT licensed Python toolbox for MCMC sampling. It is a
backwards-incompatible extension of the popular
`emcee <https://github.com/dfm/emcee>`__ library to include more
proposal distributions and other real world niceties. This documentation
won't teach you too much about MCMC but there are a lot of resources
available for that (try `this
one <http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/book.html>`__). We
also `published a paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3665>`__ explaining
the core **emcee** algorithm and implementation in detail. **emcee** and
**emcee3** have been used in `quite a few projects in the astrophysical
literature <testimonials>`__ and **emcee3** is being actively developed
on `GitHub <https://github.com/dfm/emcee3>`__.

Basic Usage
-----------

If you wanted to draw samples from a multidimensional Gaussian, you
would do something like:

.. code:: python

    import emcee3
    import numpy as np
    
    # Define the probabilistic model:
    def log_prior_function(x):
        if np.all(-10. < x) and np.all(x < 10.):
            return 0.0
        return -np.inf
    
    def log_likelihood_function(x):
        return -0.5 * np.sum(x ** 2)
    
    model = emcee3.SimpleModel(log_likelihood_function, log_prior_function)
    
    # Initialize:
    ndim, nwalkers = 10, 100
    ensemble = emcee3.Ensemble(model, np.random.randn(nwalkers, ndim))
    
    # Sample:
    sampler = emcee3.Sampler()
    ensemble = sampler.run(ensemble, 1000)

A more complete example is available in the `quickstart
documentation <user/quickstart>`__.
