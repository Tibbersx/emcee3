Installation
============

Since **emcee3** is a pure Python module, it should be pretty easy to install.
The only hard dependency is `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_.

To install this development version of **emcee3**, clone the GitHub repository
and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/dfm/emcee3.git
    cd emcee3
    git fetch
    git checkout emcee3

To install, run something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setupy.py install

To test the code, install `py.test <http://pytest.org/>`_ and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    py.test -v emcee3/testing

in the root emcee3 directory. This might take a few minutes but you shouldn't
get any errors if all went as planned.
The tests are divided into "unit" tests that run quickly and "integration"
tests that are much slower but test the overall performance of the package.
You can choose to only run the unit tests by executing:

.. code-block:: bash

    py.test -v emcee3/testing/unit


.. Using pip
.. ---------

.. The easiest way to install the most recent stable version of **emcee** is
.. with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_. Run this from the command line:

.. .. code-block:: bash

..     pip install emcee

.. You might need to run this using ``sudo`` depending on your Python
.. installation. You can also use ``easy_install``:

.. .. code-block:: bash

..     easy_install emcee

.. but ``pip`` is probably better.


.. From source
.. -----------

.. Alternatively, you can get the source by downloading a
.. `tarball <https://github.com/dfm/emcee/tarball/master>`_:

.. .. code-block:: bash

..     curl -OL https://github.com/dfm/emcee/tarball/master

.. or `zip archive <https://github.com/dfm/emcee/zipball/master>`_:

.. .. code-block:: bash

..     curl -OL https://github.com/dfm/emcee/zipball/master

.. Once you've downloaded and unpacked the source, you can navigate into the
.. root source directory and run:

.. .. code-block:: bash

..     python setup.py install


.. Bleeding edge development version
.. ---------------------------------

.. **emcee** is being developed actively on `GitHub
.. <https://github.com/dfm/emcee>`_ so if you feel like hacking, you can clone
.. the source repository

.. .. code-block:: bash

..     git clone https://github.com/dfm/emcee.git

.. or `fork the repository <https://github.com/dfm/emcee>`_.


.. Test the installation
.. ---------------------

.. To test the installation, install `py.test <http://pytest.org/>`_ and run:

.. .. code-block:: bash

..     py.test -v --pyargs emcee

.. This might take a few minutes but you shouldn't get any errors if all went
.. as planned.
